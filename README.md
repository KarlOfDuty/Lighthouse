# Lighthouse
VR Lighthouse power state management in Rust

This has been tested on SteamVR V2 lighthouses (Valve Index)  
There is no support for SteamVR V1 lighthouses (Vive)  
Pull requests welcome, I don't have any V1 lighthouses to test

Windows and Linux binaries available [here](https://github.com/ShayBox/Lighthouse/releases/latest)

## Usage

`lighthouse off`
`lighthouse on`
`lighthouse standby`
